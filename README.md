# RespeecherApi

Documentation for the API: https://gateway.respeecher.com/api/docs

## Overview

The Respeecher API is constructed around 3 main concepts: Project, Phrase and Recording.

Project is just a high level organisation. Phrase is a piece of text or audio to be transformed. Recording is an original recording or a converted one either from audio or from text through TTS.

You create a Phrase within a Project and then upload a recording or provide a text for which you then create an order to transform it into a new recording using a speech model. The resulting recording will be listed under the same Phrase. 

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. It’s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

### Manifest File

Add RespeecherApi as a package to your Package.swift file and then specify it as a dependency of the Target in which you wish to use it.

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyProject",
    platforms: [
       .macOS(.v10_15)
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/Skaggivara/RespeecherApi-swift", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.2.0"))
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "MyProject",
            dependencies: ["RespeecherApi"]),
        .testTarget(
            name: "MyProjectTests",
            dependencies: ["MyProject"]),
    ]
)
```

## Usage

Create instance of RespeechApi, authentication cookie is saved in NSUserdefaults and loaded on init. So when api instance is created first check if already authenticated.

### Check authentication:

```swift
api.isAuthenticated
```

### Login if needed:

```swift
api.login(username: username, password: password) { (authenticated, user) in
    print("authenticated: \(authenticated)")
}
```

### Listen to authStatus changes:

```swift
api.delegate = self

...

func authStatusChanged(_ sender: RespeechApi, authenticated: Bool) {
    print("authenticated: \(authenticated)")
}
```

### Fetch projects:

```swift
api.fetchProjects { projects in
    print(projects)
} onFailure: { error in
    if error == .authFailed {
        print("auth failed")
    } else {
        print("failed to fetch")
    }
}
```

### Fetch phrases for a given project:

```swift
api.fetchPhrases(projectId: projectId) { results in
    print(results)
} onFailure: { error in
    if error == .authFailed {
        print("auth failed")
    } else {
        print("failed to fetch phrases")
    }
}
```

### Fetch recordings for a given phrase:

```swift
api.fetchRecordings(phraseId: phraseId) { recordings in
    print(recordings)
} onFailure: { error in
    if error == .authFailed {
        print("auth failed")
    } else {
        print("failed to fetch recordings")
    }
}
```

### Fetch models:

```swift
api.fetchModels { models in
    print(models)
} onFailure: { error in
    if error == .authFailed {
        print("auth failed")
    } else {
        print("failed to fetch Models")
    }
}
```

### Create phrase:

```swift
api.createPhrase(projectId: projectId, phrase: phraseName) { phrase in
    print(phrase)
} onFailure: { error in
    if error == .authFailed {
        print("auth failed")
    } else {
        print("failed to create Phrase")
    }
}
```

### Create recording:

You can create a recording belonging to a phrase. A recording is a sound file in the one of the following file formats: ('wav', 'ogg', 'mp3', 'flac')

- PHRASE_ID = phrase id
- DATA = sound file data (Data) instance of sound file
- FILENAME = name of file
- MIMETYPE = sound file mime type, example: "audio/wav"

```swift
api.createRecording(phraseId: PHRASE_ID, recording: DATA, fileName: FILENAME, mimeType: MIMETYPE) { recording in
    print("recording created")
} onProgress: { progress in
    print("upload progress: \(progress)")
} onFailure: { error in
    if error == .authFailed {
        print("auth failed")
    } else {
        print("upload failed")
    }
}
```

### Create recording order:

You reference a recording's originalId to start a conversion using a specified model.

modelParams = list of parameters for model, see RespeecherModel's defaultParams()

```swift
api.createOrder(originalId: originalId, modelId: modelId, modelName: modelName, modelParams: modelParams) { recording in
    print(recording)
} onFailure: { error in
    if error == .authFailed {
        print("auth failed")
    } else {
        print("failed to created order")
    }
}
```

### Fetch TTS voices:

Before creating a TTS recording you need a TTS voice to use.

```swift
api.fetchTTSVoices { voices in
    print(voices)
} onFailure: { error in
    if error == .authFailed {
        print("auth failed")
    } else {
        print("failed to fetch Voices")
    }
}
```

### Create TTS file:

```swift
api.createTTS(phraseId: phraseId, voice: voiceName, text: text) { recording in
    print(recording)
} onFailure: { error in
    if error == .authFailed {
        print("auth failed")
    } else {
        print("failed to initiate TTS")
    }
}
```

### Download recording to Documentsdir:

```swift
api.downloadRecording(recording) { recording in
    print(recording)
} onProgress: { progress in
    print("download progress: \(progress)")
} onFailure: { error in
    if error == .authFailed {
        print("auth failed")
    } else {
        print("failed to download recording")
    }
}
```

### Get preview url for models:

Each instance of RespeecherModel has a previewUrl property, this is a guess based on preview names from respeecher website
